This repository contains the CSV files for the processed dataset used to train VoiceLDM. These files include the transcriptions generated using the Whisper model. 

### Speech Segments
- `as_speech_en.csv`
- `cv1.csv` (`cv.csv` has been split into two due to file size limitations on GitHub.)
- `cv2.csv`
- `voxceleb.csv`

### Non-Speech Segments
- `as_noise.csv`
- `noise_demand.csv`

### Evaluation Segments
Additionally, I've included the CSV file corresponding to the *ac_filtered* test set, which was specifically used to evaluate VoiceLDM.

- `ac_filtered.csv`
